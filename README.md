# Document-Scanner

1.	Rational of the work
There are hundreds of document scanner or cam scanner available in your smart phone playstore app and they give exact results as you find using an actual scanner but also deliver its drawbacks too. 
•	The application will only give an enhanced image and nothing else. 
•	It will also give out a large area of empty text area as a result of scanning and does not focus on the concerned part of the document, which is the actual text. 
•	If the background of the frame and the document has the same color or shade, then the application gives out the whole frame as a scanned image.




2.	Objectives
The objective of the application is to remove all anomalies of a conventional document scanner app (which is generally available in your smartphone playstore) and gives out a scanned image that focuses on the actual text only.
